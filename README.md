# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is called Around The U.S. This project is allowing us to get practice on coding using only Figma as our brief. Technologies used were Figma website, Triple Ten guide videos. Here is a link to my github: (https://github.com/xiongnsusan/se_project_aroundtheus.git)

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
